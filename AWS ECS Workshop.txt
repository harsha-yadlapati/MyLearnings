AWS ECS Workshop

Everything is put into docker file(contains set of instructions) and artifact is created :) --> it is image
ECS control plane is managed service, 
CPU and Memory can be the metrics of HW, but in real world scenario, it can be the netrork traffic and queue depth , that we need to monitor to autoscale
Attach IAM roles to containers, for granular level of access , which is similar to role attached to an EC2 instance

ECS Cluster --> logical namespace where containers are going to run
TASK in ECS is similar to POD in EKS
Service --> is similar to deployments + replicaSets + service  in EKS

FARGATE, removes the headache of scaling the containers and clusters
